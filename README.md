# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

# Overview of Project
The objective of the project is to know how different campaigns went in relation to the launch date and the fund goal of each play. This analysis will show the outcomes based on the launch date and fund goals.

# Analysis and Challenges
The first part of the analysis is to show the outcomes based on the launch date of the campaign. These outcomes are: successful, failed, and canceled.
A dynamic table was made to show all the campaigns for theater that were launched each month according to the final result, then I did a graph (line char) to show the relationship between outcomes and launch date

For the second part of the analysis it was requested to count the number of success, canceled, and failed plays based on the funding goal. And this is were I encountered with a challenge using the formula 'COUNTIFS()' in Excel. This formula helps to count the number of cells specified using a set of conditions. So the first condition is if the play is successful, canceled or failed, the second condition is if the campaign is only for plays, and the third condition is based on a dollar amount ranges.
My problem was when I wanted to determine the dollar amount ranges, so I dit it manually. See figure 2
