# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

# Overview of Project
The objective of the project is to know how different campaigns went in relation to the launch date and the fund goal of each play. This analysis will show the outcomes based on the launch date and fund goals.

# Analysis and Challenges
The first part of the analysis is to show the outcomes based on the launch date of the campaign. These outcomes are: successful, failed, and canceled.
A dynamic table was made to show all the campaigns for theater that were launched each month according to the final result, then we did a graph to show the relationship between outcomes and launch date
